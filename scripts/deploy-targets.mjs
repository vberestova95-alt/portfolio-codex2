/*
 * One build, two deploys.
 *
 * The default target is the full portfolio on vberestova.com. index.html and
 * everything in public/ already carry its values, so that target needs no
 * rewriting after a build — what ships is what is committed.
 *
 * Setting VITE_CASE_ONLY=true (netlify.toml does this for its production
 * context) builds the standalone Pet Injection Tracker page on its own domain
 * instead. That target has to override the head metadata, robots.txt and
 * sitemap.xml inside dist/, otherwise the two deploys claim each other's URLs
 * and compete in search results.
 *
 * The same flag is read by the app itself (src/App.jsx) to collapse routing
 * down to the single case page.
