/*
 * Pin point for the sticky case cards.
 *
 * Each card pins a little lower than the one before it, so the pinned ones
 * peek out above the card sliding over them. That only works while a card is
 * shorter than the screen: a sticky element pins by its top edge, so a card
 * taller than the viewport would stop with its bottom still off screen, and the
 * next card would cover that strip before it had ever been seen. On a phone the
 * cards run close to the full screen height, so this is the common case there.
 *
 * For those cards the pin point is lifted — negative if need be — until the
 * card's bottom edge lands just inside the viewport. The card then scrolls all
 * the way through before it stops, and the stack forms on its lower edge.
